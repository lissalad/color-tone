# Colortone
#### This project was made as for my winter intensive to experiment with an interactive audio visual display.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## Built With

[P5JS](https://p5js.org/)

[TailwindCSS](tailwindcss.com)


## Bugs

There is currently a problem where the page crashes if given too many requests, especially with refreshes.
In fact, the chrome tab will break, and may require multiple attempts before closing. 
In the future I hope to optimize my code and fix this.
